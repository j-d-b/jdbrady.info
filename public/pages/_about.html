  <h3 class="char-space">About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm an enthusiast of many things, including endurance athletics, amatuer astronomy, web devlopment, art, technology, and unconventional thinking.</p>
  <p>I like to know what I'm doing and use optimal equipment and best practices to produce professional results, whether it is in daily life with home maintenance or cooking, or in my work and hobbies.</p>
  <p>On the professional side, I work as a software developer in the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) realm. I leverage my varied skillset and diverse interests to work on all aspects of a project from design to deployment. I specialize in web development, specifically user interface design and user-facing web applications and APIs. My time is spent on higher level design, DevOps and system administration, device and system troubleshooting, and developing software. I have experience architecting enterprise web applications, single-page applications, microservice architectures, HTTP APIs, and writing technical documentation.</p>
  <p>These days, most of my time is spent working, cruising along in the outdoors, and raising my energetic dog (<a href="files/astro-front-yard.jpeg" target="_blank">Astro, Australian Shepherd</a>), and writing running shoe reviews for <a href="https://www.roadtrailrun.com" target="_blank">RoadTrailRun</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm an every day athlete, primarily a runner, and enjoy most endurance activites such as road and trail running, nordic skiing, biking (gravel, mountain, road), surfing, and hiking. I have run every day, at least two miles a day since April 2018. Check out my daily activities on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10671693">Strava</a>, the only social media I regularly use.</p></p>
  <p>Before I started working full time, I was able to put more time into artistic pursuits. I've brewed kombucha, done a few <a href="files/my_wh_replicas.jpg" target="_blank">oil paintings</a>, taken thousands of <a href="pages/portfolio.html" target="_self">photos</a>, and produced some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacobbrady/" target="_blank">songs</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/170727021" target="_blank">films</a>.</p>
  <p>I have been pescatarian since age eight, vegetarian since high school, and vegan since 2017. I'm striving to live a minimal-waste, streamlined lifestyle and raising awareness about recycling and single-use plastic.</p>
