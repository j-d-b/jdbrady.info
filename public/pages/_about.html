  <h3 class="char-space">About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm an enthusiast of many things, including endurance athletics, conserving biodiversity, amatuer astronomy, native plants, birds, software devlopment, art, and unconventional thinking.</p>
  <p>I like to use optimal equipment and best practices to produce professional results in everything that I do.</p>
  <p>As a business professional, I work for <a href="https://www.ibigroup.com/">Arcadis IBI Group</a> as a software developement manager in the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) realm. I have experience working on many aspects of software projects from design to deployment. My work includes software and interface design, DevOps, management and backlog planning, and engineering software solutions. I am skilled in architecting enterprise web applications, component-based user interfaces, microservices, web APIs, and cloud deployments, as well as writing technical documentation and following best practices.</p>
  <p>I wear test and write detailed reviews of running shoes for <a href="https://www.roadtrailrun.com" target="_blank">RoadTrailRun</a>.</p>
  <p>These days, my time is spent working, being outside running or learning about the natural world, and raising my energetic dog (<a href="files/astro-front-yard.jpeg" target="_blank">Astro, Australian Shepherd</a>). Throughout all these activities, I am learning and improving.</p>
  <p>Health is critical to performance in all aspects of life. I'm an every day athlete, primarily a competitive runner, and enjoy most endurance activites such as road and trail running, nordic skiing, biking (gravel, mountain, road, fat), surfing, walking, and hiking. I have run every day, at least two miles a day since April 2018. Check out my daily activities on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10671693">Strava</a>, the only social media that I use.</p></p>
  <p>Before I started working full time, I was able to put more time into artistic pursuits. I've brewed kombucha, done a few <a href="files/my_wh_replicas.jpg" target="_blank">oil paintings</a>, taken thousands of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/192778444@N07/albums" target="_blank">photos</a>, and produced <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacobbrady/" target="_blank">songs</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/170727021" target="_blank">films</a>.</p>
  <p>I have been pescatarian since age eight, vegetarian since high school, and vegan since 2017.</p>
  <p>I recently realized the magnitude of destruction current human behaviors have on the natural processes of the earth and am working towards having a net positive impact. This involves considering the planet before my own desires and going against cultural norms. I am actively learning about native plants and birds; I am restoring native habitat in all areas I can and encouraging others to rethink things that are culturally acceptable but damaging to the planet.</p>
