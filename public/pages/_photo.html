  <p>I used to put more time into photography and understand the fundamentals of optics, light, and photographic techniques. These days, I don't dedicate time to shoot or process, so the content here is historical (pre-2018).</p>
  <p>I am drawn to framing and the aesthetic qualities of images. I prefer timelapse, astrophotography, landscape, and framing/layout-focused 'art' photos.</p>
  <p>I have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacob_brady1/" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>, but longer update it. I also processed astronomical images for the Mittleman Observatory while at school at Middlebury College.</p>
