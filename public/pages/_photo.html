  <p>I used to put more time into photography and have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of optics, light, and photographic techniques. These days, I haven't made time to shoot or process, so much of the content here is historical.</p>
  <p>I have always been drawn to framing and the aesthetic qualities of an image. I prefer timelapse, astrophotography, landscape, and framing/layout-focused 'art' photos.</p>
  <p>I use an iPhone XS Max and Fujifilm X-T1.</p>
  <p>I also have a 714mm f/7 ED refractor telescope which I can leverage for lunar photography.</p>

  <p>The gallery below is very old and I should transition to a hosted solution, but I'll keep it up for now:</p>
