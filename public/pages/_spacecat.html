  <p class="pt-3">SPACECAT is a precision platform game, which involves navigating our hero, the spacecat, to the exit portal.</p>
  <p>It requires measured, precise movement and visual awareness, as well as speed.</p>
  <p>SPACECAT was created with <a href="https://github.com/imcinerney" target="_blank">imcinerney</a> for a functional programming course in 2016. I later put more work into cleaning it up and adding features after the course for a v1.1 release in early January, 2017.</p>
  <p>Instructions are included in the zip.</p>
