  <p class="pt-3">I piloted the design, development, and deployment of a mobile-friendly, web-based TAS for BCTC.</p> 
  <p>I built the BCTC TAS entirely solo, starting from working directly with the client to produce the design documentation. This was a milestone for me and a great opportunity.</p>
  <p>The TAS enables customers to schedule container pickups/drop-offs and BCTC employees to manage and restrict the appointments.</p>
  <p>I wrote the project design documents, implemented the user-facing web application and web GraphQL API backend, deployed the system on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and served as the primary technical point of interaction with the client.</p>
