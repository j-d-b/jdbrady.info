I'm going to rewrite my personal site with React as soon as I have time, so stay tuned. Learned **a lot** since I did this.

This repo is extremely disorganized currently as I just threw some stuff together in the process of *updating* my old personal site, which was my second web project *ever*, back in the day. 

Didn't even get to organizing the files, as I started learning React when I was partway through this, so I go it to an acceptable point, published it, and thought I'd get back to it soon.

Lot's to do here...
