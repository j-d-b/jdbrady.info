  <p class="pt-3">I wanted to make an album and had a good block of time in summer 2017 after graduating college. It was my first shot at making music with vocals and lyrics.</p>
  <p>This short album is mostly improvised or <span class="font-italic">brain is smarter than you</span> stuff.</p>
  <p>True to its name, the songs in skechers in air are lightly processed and largely made by me writing words onto a note without thinking, then trying to sing them and recording what came out.</p>
  <p>I'd like to make more developed pieces if I ever have time.</p>
